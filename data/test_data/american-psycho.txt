Most of the summer I spent in a stupor, sitting either in my once or in new restaurants, in my apartment watching videotapes or in the backs of cabs,
in nightclubs that just opened or in movie theaters, at the building in Hell's Kitchen or in new restaurants.
There were four major air disasters this summer, the majority of them captured on videotape, almost as if these events had been planned, and repeated on television endlessly.
The planes kept crashing in slow motion, followed by countless roaming shots of the wreckage and the same random views af the burned,
bloody carnage, weeping rescue workers retrieving body parts.
I started using Oscar de la Renta men's deodorant, which gave me a slight rash.
A movie about a small talking bug was released to great fanfare and grossed over two hundred million dollars.
The Mets were doing badly.
Beggars and homeless seemed to have multiplied in August and the ranks of the unfortunate, weak and aged lined the streets everywhere.
I found myself asking too many summer associates at too many dinners in flashy new restaurants before taking them to Les Miserables if anyone had seen The Toolbox Murders on HBO and silent tables would stare back at me,
before I would cough politely and summon the waiter over for the check, or I'd ask for sorbet or,
if this was earlier in the dinner, for another bottle of San Pellegrino, and then I'd ask the summer associates, "No?" and assure them, "It was quite good."
My platinum American Express card had gone through so much use that it snapped in half, self-destructed, at one of those dinners, when I took two summer associates to Restless and Young,
the new Pablo Lester restaurant in midtown, but I had enough cash in my gazelleskin wallet to pay for the meal.
The Patty Winters Show s were all repeats.
Life remained a blank canvas, a cliche, a soap opera.
I felt lethal, on the verge of frenzy.
My nightly bloodlust overflowed into my days and I had to leave the city.
My mask of sanity was a victim of impending slippage.
This was the bone season for me and I needed a vacation. I needed to go to the Hamptons.
I suggested this to Evelyn and, like a spider, she accepted.

The house we stayed at was actually Tim Price's, which Evelyn had the keys to for some reason, but in my stupefied state I refused to ask for specifics.
Tim's house was on the water in East Hampton and was adorned with many gable roofs and was four stories high, all connected by a galvanized-steel staircase,
and had what at first I thought was a Southwestern motif but wasn't.
The kitchen was one thousand square feet of pure minimalist design; one wall held everything: two huge ovens, massive cupboards, a walk-in freezer, a three-door refrigerator.
An island of custom-crafted stainless steel divided the kitchen into three separate spaces.
Four of the nine bathrooms contained trompe l'oeil paintings and five of them had antique lead ram's heads that hung over the sink, water spouting from their mouths.
All the sinks and bathtubs and showers were antique marble and the floors were composed of tiny marble mosaics.
A television was built into a wall alcove above the master bathtub. Every room had a stereo.
The house also contained twelve Frank Lloyd Wright standing lamps, fourteen Josef Heffermann club chairs,
two walls of floor-to-ceiling videocassette cases and another wall stacked solely with thousands of compact discs encased in glass cabinets.
A chandelier by Eric Schmidt hung in the front entranceway, below it stood an Atomic Ironworks steel moose hatrack by a Young sculptor I'd never heard of.
A round nineteenth-century Russian dining table sat in a room adjacent to the kitchen, but had no chairs.
Spooky photographs by Cindy Sherman lined the walls everywhere.
There was an exercise room.
There were eight walk-in closets, five VCRs, a Noguchi glass and walnut dining table, a hall table by Marc Schaffer and a fax machine.
There was a topiary tree in the master bedroom next to a Louis XVI window bench.
An Eric Fischl painting hung over one of the marble fireplaces. There was a tennis court.
There were two saunas and an indoor Jacuzzi in a small guesthouse that sat by the pool, which was black-bottomed.
There were stone columns in odd places.

I really tried to make things work the weeks we were out there.
Evelyn and I rode bicycles and jogged and played tennis.
We talked about going to the south of France or to Scotland; we talked about driving through Germany and visiting unspoiled opera houses.
We went windsurfing. We talked about only romantic things: the light on eastern Long Island, the moonrise in October over the hills of the Virginia hunt country.
We took baths together in the big marble tubs.
We had breakfast in bed, snuggling beneath cashmere blankets after I'd poured imported coffee from a Melior pot into Herm`es cups.
I woke her up with fresh flowers.
I put notes in her Louis Vuitton carry bag before she left for her weekly facials in Manhattan.
I bought her a puppy, a small black chow, which she named NutraSweet and fed dietetic chocolate trues to.
I read long passages aloud from Doctor Zhivago and A Farewell to Arms (my favorite Hemingway).
I rented movies in town that Price didn't own, mostly comedies from the 1930s, and played them on one of the many VCRs, our favorite being Roman Holiday, which we watched twice.
We listened to Frank Sinatra (only his 1950s period) and Nat King Cole's After Midnight, which Tim had on CD.
I bought her expensive lingerie, which sometimes she wore.

After skinny-dipping in the ocean late at night, we would come into the house, shivering, draped in huge Ralph Lauren towels, and we'd make omelets and noodles tossed with olive oil and truffles and porcini mushrooms;
we'd make souffles with poached pears and cinnamon fruit salads, grilled polenta with peppered salmon, apple and berry sorbet, mascarpone,
red beans with arrozo wrapped in romaine lettuce, bowls of salsa and skate poached in balsamic vinegar, chilled tomato soup and risottos flavored with beets and lime and asparagus and mint,
and we drank lemonade or champagne or well-aged bottles of Ch^ateau Margaux.
But soon we stopped lifting weights together and wing laps and Evelyn would eat only the dietetic chocolate trues that NutraSweet hadn't eaten, complaining about weight she hadn't gained.
Some nights I would find my self roaming the beaches, digging up baby crabs and eating handfuls of sand—this was in the middle of the night when the sky was so clear I could see the entire solar system and the sand,
lit by it, seemed almost lunar in scale.

I even dragged a beached jellyfish back to the house and microwaved it early one morning, predawn, while Evelyn slept, and what I didn't eat of it I fed to the chow.
Sipping bourbon, then champagne, from cactus-etched highball glasses, which Evelyn would set on adobe coasters and into which she would stir raspberry cassis with papier-mache jalape~no-shaped stirrers,
I would lie around, fantasizing about killing someone with an Allsop Racer ski pole, or I would stare at the antique weather vane that hung above one of the fireplaces, wondering wild-eyed if I could stab anyone with it,
then I'd complain aloud, whether Evelyn was in the room or not, that we should have made reservations at Dick Loudon's Stratford Inn instead.
Evelyn soon started talking only about spas and cosmetic surgery and then she hired a masseur, some scary faggot who lived down the road with a famous book publisher and who flirted openly with me.
Evelyn went back to the city three times that last week we were in the Hamptons, once for a manicure and a pedicure and a facial, the second time for a one-on-one training session at Stephanie Herman, and finally to meet with her astrologer.
"Why helicopter in?" I asked in a whisper.
"What do you want me to do?" she shrieked, popping another dietetic true into her mouth. "Rent a Volvo?"

While she was gone I would vomit—just to do it—into the rustic terracotta jars that lined the patio in front or I would drive into town with the scary masseur and collect razor blades.
At night I'd place a faux-concrete and aluminum-wire sconce by Jerry Kott over Evelyn's head and since she'd be so knocked out on Halcion she wouldn't brush it off,
and though I laughed at this, while the sconce rose evenly with her deep breathing, soon it made me sad and I stopped placing the sconce over Evelyn's head.
Everything failed to subdue me.
Soon everything seemed dull: another sunrise, the lives of heroes, falling in love, war, the discoveries people made about each other.
The only thing that didn't bore me, obviously enough, was how much money Tim Price made, and yet in its obviousness it did.
There wasn't a clear, identifiable emotion within me, except for greed and, possibly, total disgust.
I had all the characteristics of a human being—flesh, blood, skin, hair—but my depersonalization was so intense,
had gone so deep, that the normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated, the victim of a slow, purposeful erasure.
I was simply imitating reality, a rough resemblance of a human being, with only a dim corner of my mind functioning.
Something horrible was happening and yet I couldn't figure out why—I couldn't put my finger on it.
The only thing that calmed me was the satisfying sound of ice being dropped into a glass of J&B.
Eventually I drowned the chow, which Evelyn didn't miss; she didn't even notice its absence, not even when I threw it in the walk-in freezer,
wrapped in one of her sweaters from Bergdorf Goodman.

We had to leave the Hamptons because I would find myself standing over our bed in the hours before dawn, with an ice pick gripped in my fist,
waiting for Evelyn to open her eyes. At my suggestion, one morning over breakfast, she agreed,
and on the last Sunday before Labor Day we returned to Manhattan by helicopter.
