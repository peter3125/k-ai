            member of a set satisfies.
            An intensional definition of a robot is like:
            x is a Robot if and only if:
            1. x has a computer "brain"
            2. x can move
            3. x has "sensors"

        <pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
        <template>
            David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell". XML is the Extensible
            Markup Language. Like many "standards" in computer science, XML
            is a moving target. In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized
            version of HTML. Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which
            look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.
            AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized
            language for artificial intelligence.
            One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools
            to edit and manipulate XML format files. Another reason is that an
            XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already
            familiar with HTML. Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of
            AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable
            convenience for programming web chat robots.
            A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.

        <template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make
            machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand,
            most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying
            people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve
            much more computing than people can do.

        <template>
            The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological machine being intelligent is incoherent.
            The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the
            idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn't
            reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they
            invested in went bankrupt.
